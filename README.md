Servo controlled Mechanical Iris for the [DorkbotPDX Exquisite Corpse](http://dorkbotpdx.org/blog/breedx/exquisite_corpse).

For me, my part of this project reinforced the idea that the first version is ALWAYS THE PROTOTYPE and WILL FAIL.  Accept, learn, and refucking do it.  My part is a machanical iris that is laser cut from 1/8 thick acrylic and driven by a servo.  

The first version had a laser cut gear attached directly to a servo which drove teeth that were attached to the iris.  It worked for a little while, but the iris had too much friction in it to work for very long.  This is where I learned about mechanical tolerances.  I needed to keep some parts of the system very friction free, and other parts very tight.  For the first version, I was timecrunched and ad to leave for a trip to Asia, so I didn't have time to redo it.

The second version had the servo directly move the iris with better tolerances and is much more reliable.  Somewhere in this mess of PDF and Illustrator files is the working fun version of the iris.  If there is interest I can try and clean this up a bit.

This is public domain work.  If you find this useful at all, use it!
